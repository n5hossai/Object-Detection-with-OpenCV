# Object-Detection-with-OpenCV
Using pretrained images from the coco.names dataset, created a small fun project to detect the object using mobilenet-ssd

## Simply clone or download the the folder, and run in your favorite IDE. (Make sure you install opencv-python package prior to running)
## Currently, the program cannot run long enough since it runs out of computer memory, but re-run the program to test it
## Email me at naymulhossain21@gmail.com to suggest changes. Thank you
